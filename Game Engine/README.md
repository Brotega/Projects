# Game Engine


## Description
This is a game engine I worked on for a class project. The engine is written in C++ using DirectX 11 and HLSL.

## My role
Implemented many features of the game engine:
- All graphics
- 3D skeletal animation
- Profiling
- Memory allocation
- Physics (gravity simulation and AABB collision detection)
- Moving character based on player input (WASD keys) and making them jump (spacebar)
- Multithreading
