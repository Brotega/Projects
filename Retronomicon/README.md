# Retronomicon **There's no executable for this project. See the Video Link header for a gameplay link.**

## Description
Retronomicon is a puzzle arcade game developed in Unity using the C# programming language. In this game, the player must 
figure out how to send a physics-driven ball towards the end goal to complete the level. There are a wide variety of levels
that can be played, since the game features a level creation system that allows players to share and upload their levels online. There are many level objects and powerups that a player can put in their created level. This means each level has a unique solution 
for being solved. Retronomicon is currently targeted for Android devices. 

## My Role
I am the **tech artist** for this team project. My main duties have been implementing shaders to some of the level objects and all 
UI elements. To help achieve retro-style aethestic, I created my own simple textures to sample from. Since the game is still 
in development, I will work on creating VFX (particle systems) for some of the level objects.

## Video Link
Since Retronomicon is targeted for Android devices, we cannot change our build settings to create an executable for a PC version.
Therefore in addition to images provided in this folder, I will provide a video link that shows gameplay to see my work in motion.
