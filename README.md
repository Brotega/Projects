# Projects
Hello, in here you will find all the projects I've worked on as a developer. Feel free to check them out! Simply download or clone
the Projects repository here at https://github.com/Brotega/Projects if you plan on playing or viewing my projects.
 
In addition to executables or images/videos of projects, each folder will contain a README.md with more information about each 
project, including my duties. If you are an employer and wish to see any source code of my work, feel free to contact me at 
ortegaam@usc.edu.
