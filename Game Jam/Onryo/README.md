## Game Description
Onryo is a 2D horror game about a person (the player) who wakes up in the house of a geisha, whose angry spirit lives there. With 
only a flashlight, the player must navigate through the darkness, collecting the artifacts scattered around the home. Place
the objects, one by one, on the spell circle located at the front of the house in order to exorcise the geisha and escape the house.

This game was made for the spring MEGA Game Jam 2020 at the University of Southern California. It is developed in Unity using the C# 
programming language.

## My Role 
As a gameplay programmer, here's the list of my duties:
- Flashlight: Added 2D lighting that allows the player to see in the darkness, and revealing the full spirit of the geisha 
when in range of the flashlight, done using vector math.
- Movement: Grid-based movement with Unity's raycasting to prevent collision against walls.
- UI: Display text for when player cannot proceed through door/closet
