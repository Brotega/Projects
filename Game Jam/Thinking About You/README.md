## Game Description
Ever had special feelings for someone, and always wanted to tell them what you truly feel inside? Thinking About You is a fun two player
competitive game about an angel and devil who influence the outcome of such feelings. The angel and devil must grab words whose meaning 
goes with their personality (good words for the angel and bad words for the devil). Then put those words in the blank lines of the sentences 
to complete them. Be aware though! The angel and devil can also take out the words from the sentences to replace with their own words.

This game was made for the Global Game Jam 2020. It is developed in Unity using the C# programming language.

## My Role 
As a gameplay programmer, here's the list of my duties:
- Controls: Implemented basic movement, jumping, and the ability to throw grabbed words.
- Words: Implemented ability to grab words and place them on the sentences
- Game state: Recording the scores of each player, as well changing (by interpolating) the background music and atmospheric color according to 
who is currently winning.
