## Game Description
W1ll 0verfl0w is a 2D side-scroller game about a character named W1ll. W1ll's very own free will is being threatened by viruses
that only target the UI regarding W1ll's status. This includes his health status; if the viruses take out all of W1ll's five 
hearts, then it's game over! You must control W1ll and fight to survive. W1ll himself can interact with his own UI, so use this
as an opportunity to take out any infected UI. W1ll's goal is to activate the anti-virus located at the end of the level. 
Doing so will guarantee W1ll his free will, or will it?

W1ll 0verfl0w is a game developed by a group of passionate gamers. This game was made for the Newbies and Vets Game Jam 2019 at 
the University of Southern California. It is developed in Unity using the C# programming language.

## My Role 
As a gameplay programmer, here's the list of my duties:
- Camera shake: Implemented a camera shake feature that occurs right after activating the anti-virus.
- Enemy spawn: Created the spawn system that spawns enemies over time from a range of random locations
- Enemy AI behavior: Implemented enemy behavior that makes the enemy target and go toward an available player UI slot. If 
successful, the enemy infects that slot, affecting the player status, whether it be damaging their health, slowing their movement 
speed, activating reverse player controls, or decreasing jump speed.
