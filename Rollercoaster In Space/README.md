# Rollercoaster In Space

## Description
This is a video of a graphics programming project I did using C++11 and OpenGL, using the GLSL shader language.

Here is a video link as well (same as the video included in this folder): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8_-gS7uQEco

## Tasks done
- Skybox: Implemented a skybox using a cubemap with space textures.
- Rollercoaster track: Rendered a roller coaster track using a Catmull-Rom spline. Track is shaded using Phong shading.
- Outline: Rendered an outline for the track.
- Camera movement: Moved and changed orientation of the camera based on the tangent vectors at each point of the spline.
